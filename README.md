# Breadth-First-Search

This program uses a "Breadth First Search" algorithm and graphs to solve two similar puzzles called "The Wolf, Goat, and Cabbage", and "Water Jugs"

The Wolf, Goat, and Cabbage - 

You are standing with a wolf, goat, and cabbage, next to a river, and you would like to transport all three of these items to the other side. However, you only have access to a small boat that can fit at most one item (besides yourself). If you leave the wolf and goat alone unattended, bad things happen to the goat. If you leave the goat and cabbage unattended, bad things happen to the cabbage.

Water Jugs - 

You are standing next to a river with a very content-looking wolf, a head of cabbage, and two water jugs, which have integer sizes A = 3 and B = 4. In order to boil the cabbage for your dinner, you would like to measure out exactly 5 units of water.
